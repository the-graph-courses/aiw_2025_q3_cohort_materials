# Overview

In this session you will try two small but practical GenAI design workflows:

1.  **Create a promotional flyer** for our course showcase using **Ideogram** for image generation and **Canva** for final editing. (You're encouraged to embed this on your website, and share this flyer with colleagues and friends to get them to come to the showcase.)

2.  (**Optional challenge**) **Turn a research paper into a visual abstract** using **Claude** and **HTML** or **SVG**.

# Task 1 – AI Flyer for the Final Presentation

**Account Required**: You'll need a free **Ideogram.ai** account. Sign up at **ideogram.ai** if you haven't already.

2.  In the prompt box, describe the image you want to create. Copy and paste the following recommended prompt, or you can create your own prompt. In the recommended prompt, replace `[YOUR WEBSITE NAME HERE]` with your actual website name. You can also replace the theme colors with your own. A good place to get theme colors is [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/){target="_blank"}
Feel free to experiment with other aspects of the prompt. 

```         
Create an elegant modern, abstract, minimalist flyer for the following event:
► Main headline: "Graph Courses – AI Portfolio Showcase Day".
► Sub-headline: "Generative AI for Work & Research".
► Date and Time
   • Sunday, October 5, 5pm GMT
   • Wednesday, October 8, 3pm GMT
► "To register: Visit [YOUR WEBSITE NAME HERE] or scan the QR code, then use the chat feature to tell the AI agent you'd like to attend the showcase."
► Our theme colors are [dark teal, light teal, and yellow].
```

- Change the aspect ratio to 3:4 for a more poster-like format.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1-B Fix typography

AI-generated text in the images are likely to be error-ridden or gibberish. To fix this, we can use Canva's Grab Text feature to make the text editable and fix the errors.

Hover over the image you would like to use, and click the bottom right "edit" button.

![Alt text](images/CleanShot%202025-09-21%20at%2008.20.56@2x.jpg)

In the view that pops up, click the edit button in the top left. 

![Alt text](images/CleanShot%202025-09-21%20at%2009.04.37@2x.jpg)

Then click on Grab Text under Magic Studio. You may need to scroll right to see it. 

![Alt text](images/CleanShot%202025-09-21%20at%2009.05.02@2x.jpg)

Wait a moment for the Ai to identigy the potential text sections. Then click on "All text" then "Grab"

### Optional. Fix blemishes. 

After grabbing text, there may be some blemishes on the background graphic. We can use the "Magic Eraser" tool from Magic Studio to fix this.

![Alt text](images/CleanShot%202025-09-21%20at%2009.11.34@2x.jpg)

Then adjust your brush size, brush it over the blemishes, and click "Erase".

You can also try the magic edit tool

Detailed edits are hard to do on Canva as it is not meant as a design tool. 

You can use photopea which is a online free clone of photoshop.

But has long learning curve.

### 1-C Share & Upload

1.  Click on "Share" at the top right of the Canva page.
2.  Click on "Download", change the file type to "PDF Standard" and click "Download".
3.  Upload the PDF to your assignment submission area on the course page.

# Optional Challenge – AI Visual Abstracts

**Account Required**: You'll need a free **Claude.ai** account. Sign up at **claude.ai** if you haven't already.

In this section, we'll use AI and design tools to turn a research paper into a visual abstract. A visual abstract is a pictorial representation of the main findings of a research paper, and is a great way to communicate the key results of a paper in an appealing visual format.

### 2-A Choose Your Paper

Pick any recent research paper you are interested in. Make sure you have access to both the paper title and abstract text, as you'll need to copy and paste these into Claude in the next step.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2-B Generate Visual Abstract with Claude

Go to **claude.ai** and log in to your account. Use Claude to create either an SVG or HTML-based "visual abstract" of your chosen paper.

(We recommend Claude over ChatGPT for this task because 
- a) it tends to be better at design tasks, and 
- b) it gives you an easy way to download SVG code.

Choose one of the following two approaches (SVG or HTML) and give Claude the corresponding prompt. Feel free to try both approaches and compare the results.

**Option 1: SVG Visual Abstract**
```         
Create an SVG code-based visual abstract of the following paper:

[Paper Title]
[Paper Abstract]
```

**Option 2: HTML Visual Abstract**

```         
Create an HTML visual abstract of the following paper:

[Paper Title]
[Paper Abstract]
```

After Claude generates the initial design, you can ask it to make specific changes or improvements to refine the visual abstract.

### 2-C Edit and Finalize

**If you chose SVG:**

1.  In Claude, click on the dropdown arrow at the top right of the SVG preview
2.  Click on "Download SVG"

![Download SVG in Claude](images/download_svg.jpg)

3.  Open PowerPoint and drag the downloaded SVG file into a slide
4.  To make the elements editable, you need to ungroup/convert the SVG: 
   - **For Mac users**: Right-click on the image, click on "Group", then "Ungroup". You may need to repeat this process several times until there's nothing left to ungroup.

![Ungroup in Powerpoint for Mac](images/ungroup_mac.jpg) 

   - **For Windows users**: Right-click on the image and click on "Convert to shape".

![Ungroup in Powerpoint for Windows](images/convert_to_shape_windows.png) 

5.  Now you can make any edits you need to individual elements
6.  When finished, export as a PDF or take a screenshot of your slide

**If you chose HTML:**

1.  Copy the HTML code from Claude's response
2.  Go to **grapesjs.com** (a free visual HTML editor) and open the editor
3.  Paste the HTML code into the editor
4.  Use the visual interface to edit the design as needed
5.  For detailed guidance on editing with GrapesJS, watch this video:

6. When you're satisfied with your design, take a screenshot of the final result.

### 2-D Submit Your Work

Upload your final visual abstract (PDF, screenshot, or exported file) to your assignment submission area on the course page. The page should allow multiple submissions. (After you upload one file, simply repeat the process to upload another file.)
